# Legacy Grafarg Backend Plugins

This repository is for Grafarg's old version of backend plugins. As of Grafarg 7.0, backend plugins have been [updated and offically supported](https://grafarg.com/docs/grafarg/latest/developers/plugins/backend/). The new backend plugin SDK that replaces this is located at https://github.com/famarks/grafarg-plugin-sdk-go.
